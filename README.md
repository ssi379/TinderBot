# TinderBot

I have created this bot because I read this article: http://www.ydesouza.com/tinder
I thought, I can do that too, and because I am currently learning Go I decided to code it in Go as an exercise.

## Usage
* Clone repository
* At line 13 of TinderBot.go enter your own auth token. (See the article on how to find your token)

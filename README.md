# TinderBot

I have created this bot because I read this article: http://www.ydesouza.com/tinder
I thought, I can do that too, and because I am currently learning Go I decided to code it in Go as an exercise.

## Usage
* Clone repository
* Build using go build
* Run application

## Disclaimer
This bot is not perfect and may contain bugs.i

## Update 3/10/2015
Since Tinder rate limited their API there is not much use for this bot, but if you want to try it out, it still works.
